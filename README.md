# RNA_seq_timecourse
This experiment encompassed time course samples throughout the yeast growth cycle for 3 yeast strains. S. pombe cells were spiked into each sample based on S. cerevisiae cell count. This was done to maintain a fixed ratio of S. cerevisiae to S. pombe cells in each samples. The S. pombe cells were used to normalize S. cerevisiae data in order to measure absolute changes in RNA abundance accross phases of yeast growth wherein RNA content/cell can vary greatly. Normalization was implemented via RUVseq and DEseq2. I collected all of the samples and performed the time course, sample collection (triplicate biological replicates) for each, and cell counting/spikeing in of pombe cells. The samples were evenly divided amongst students in the BIOMG8300 course. Students prepared RNA-seq libraries using the Illumina Trueseq directional II kit (I'm not 100% this was the kit). 

The shell scripts include the processing that the students performed. The r script contains functions for normalization, differential expression analysis, and normalization plots.
